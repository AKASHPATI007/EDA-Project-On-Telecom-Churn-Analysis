**

Focus on top churned state first.
Area code have not that much role. we can neglect area code.
Focus on customer who did'nt picked voice mail plan as there churning rate is high
Improve customer service call centre responce may be customer query can't resolve that's why they were calling to customer again and again ande then churn
Focus on customer who had taken international plan . Try to revise plan may reduce plan price little bit.
Improve network connection, specially focus on top churned satates.
Give some discount offer after certain min day call because as day call increase our churning rate is also increase and we were loosing our valuable customers.
We did not able to analys any valuable information with account length.

Conclusion


we stated data analysisng with univariate in which we seen different distributions of all data. Then we comes on bivariate analysis in which we different categorical and numerical variables with churn found out that top churned states were [ NJ, CA, TX, MD, SC].Then we see voicemail plan and international plan analysis with churn and get result that who have voice mail plan churned less. and the data who is having international plan were churning more. And when I analyse customer call then saw that moree than 3 customer call were churning more. And also when I compare day, eve ,night and international call then I saw that international charge rate is higher than all the other charge rate. and also when I compare total day minute with churn then comes to know that more than 240 day min churning were high.

So based on all this result I gave above suggestions which may be helpful for telecom business growing and retention of customers which may increase company profit.
